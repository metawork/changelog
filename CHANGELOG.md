### 2021-10-29 (Build 20211029-172859.e16aa2ab)
- **[BUG]** We fixed a backwards-incompatible data change that resulted in old recordings failing to load.

### 2021-10-29 (Build 20211029-091740.107e4267)
- **[FEAT]** We've added a panel where you can view useful metadata about your recording.

  ![Metadata dropdown](https://static.metawork.com/images/metadata_dropdown.png)
  
  Let us know if there are other pieces of information you'd like see here!
  
- **[LANG]** The following language versions have been removed and will be automatically updated:
  | Old | New |
  | --- | --- |
  | Ruby 2.7.3 | Ruby 2.7.4 |
  | Node 16.11.1 | Node 16.13.0 |
  
  Our policy is to be fairly aggressive with language updates during the alpha, but would appreciate feedback on cadence.
- **[MISC]** We removed the automatic waitlist for new users
  
  We think the software has stabilized enough that we can remove this obstacle to getting started for new users.
